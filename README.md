## AI Features

### Cover Letter Generator
Candidates can generate a personalized cover letter on the job detail page. The AI reads the job description and the candidate's skills and bio to write a tailored cover letter that the candidate can edit before submitting.

### Match Score
When a company views applications for a job listing, each applicant automatically receives an AI-generated match score (0–100%) with a one-line explanation of why they are or aren't a good fit. Scores are color coded — green for strong matches, yellow for partial, red for weak.

Both features are powered by the backend AI endpoint — the API key is never exposed to the browser.
